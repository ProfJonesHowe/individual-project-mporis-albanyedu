	At last the end has come <br><br>
	For CYBR201 <br><br>
	But let's reflect on some <br><br>
	Of the things that we've done <br><br>
	We learned about the web <br><br>
	Design and history <br><br>
	We learned HTML <br><br>
	The basics made easy <br><br>
	Format with CSS <br><br>
	Websites pleasant to see <br><br>
	It helps avoid a mess <br><br>
	Mobile friendliness key <br><br>
	We did some JavaScript <br><br>
	Making functions is fun <br><br>
	Now we are well equipped <br><br>
	To design at least one <br><br>
	We did a group project <br><br>
	Presented at Showcase <br><br>
	It had a good effect <br><br>
	Inside the Cyber Space <br><br>
	We also did some labs <br><br>
	To learn how to make sites <br><br>
	But now we close the tabs <br><br>
	And end these few highlights <br><br>
